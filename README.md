# Memory-Explorer
Memory Explorer is an experimental forensics tool to look at Windows Memory.
It can work on a raw memory image, such as a .vmem file from a VMware virtual machine.
It can also work on a live system using a device driver to access the memory.

Did I say it's experimental!

Oh and it also allows me to start to use WPF, which is something I've dabbled with for a while.

Oh2 and it also allows me to start to try out MVVM, which is something else I've dabbled with.

##Installation

There's no installer. Just extract the folder from the zip file and run MemoryExplorer.exe.

I'm not adding anything to your registry, or dropping files in other directories.

##Uninstall

Just delete the folder, that's it. You may also want to remove your profile and projects folders, if you don't need them any more.
