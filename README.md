# Memory-Explorer
Memory Explorer is an experimental forensics tool to look at Windows Memory.
It can work on a raw memory image, such as a .vmem file from a VMware virtual machine.
It can also work on a live system using a device driver to access the memory.

Did I say it's experimental!

Oh and it also allows me to start to use WPF, which is something I've dabbled with for a while.

Oh2 and it also allows me to start to try out MVVM, which is something else I've dabbled with.
